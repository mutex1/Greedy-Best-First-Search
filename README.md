# Greedy-Best-First-Search

An implementation of pathfinding using GBS a.k.a. Greedy Best-first Search <br>
multiple goal maze solving <br>
<br>
usage : <br>
execute t:his code with GBS.py and input.txt ex) python GBS.py input.txt output.txt <br>
it will generate the path  <br>
1 means wall (can't pass) <br>
2 means road (can pass)<br>
3 means start node<br>
4 means final node (it can be multiple)<br>
5 means the best path<br>
length means the length of best path (number of 5)<br>
time means whole search time (how many nodes were checked)<br>
